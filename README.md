# 🚗 Car Price Prediction App

Welcome to the Car Price Prediction App! This project uses machine learning to estimate the price of a car based on various input features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more.

## 📦 Features

- Predict car prices using trained ML models
- Interactive UI for inputting car details
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Deployment-ready structure

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Streamlit / Flask (for UI)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
